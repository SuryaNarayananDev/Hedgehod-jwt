# JWT Client-Server Authentication System Template

## 🔐 Overview

This project is a **functional client-server authentication template using JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**. It provides a solid starting point for developers looking to implement secure user authentication in web applications using token-based login.

The system includes:

* A backend server that handles user registration, login, token issuance, and verification
* A **React-based frontend client** that interacts with the server and manages user sessions using JWT
* Basic security practices including password hashing and token expiration

## 🎯 Purpose

This template is intended for educational, prototyping, or starter-project purposes. It helps developers understand and implement:

* Stateless authentication using JWT
* Token handling and storage (e.g., localStorage)
* Protected routes and user session management

## 🚀 Technologies Used

**Server (API):**

* Node.js
* Express.js
* JWT (`jsonwebtoken`)
* bcrypt for password hashing

**Client (Frontend):**

* React
* React Router
* Fetch API for communication with the server

## 📁 Features

* User registration and login
* JWT token generation and validation
* Middleware for protecting routes (backend)
* Authenticated routes and session handling (frontend)
* Secure password storage with bcrypt

## 📖 Usage

This project is **free and open for public use**. You can:

* Clone or fork this repository
* Customize it for your own project
* Use it in personal or commercial applications

## 🧰 Getting Started

### 📦 Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SuryaNarayananDev/JWT-Authentication-System-template.git

```

---

## 🖥️ Client Setup (React)

The client is developed in React by **SuryaNarayananDev**.

### Steps:

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

The React development server will start by default.

---

## 🔧 Server Setup (Node.js + Express)

```bash
cd server
npm install
node index.js
```

Server runs on (http://localhost:8080) by default.

---

## 🔒 Environment Variables (Server)

Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory:

```
DB=MONGO_DB_CONNECTION || //localhost:27017/authDB
JWTPRIVATEKEY=RANDOM_STRING
```

---

## ✨ Future Improvements

* Refresh token implementation
* Role-based access control
* Email verification and password reset
* Persistent sessions using cookies
